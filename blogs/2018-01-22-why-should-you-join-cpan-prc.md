Why should you join CPAN-PRC?
2018-01-21T22:00:00Z

Perl community is full of creative ideas, and CPAN Pull Request Challenge is one of them. You might have seen some blogs, or have heard someone mention it, but it doesn't get the attention it deserves. So here's a quick post that explains what it is, how it works, and why you should join too.


# What it is

[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/), to remind, is the famous archive of  Perl modules. It hosts well over 30k modules, all solving different  problems. There are extra programs like [CPAN Testers](http://cpantesters.org/), an intuitive to run tests for all modules. There is [an issue tracker](https://rt.cpan.org/), [a test coverage tracker](http://cpancover.com), [a quality measure](https://cpants.cpanauthors.org/) et cetera. All these will be handy when you are looking for "something to fix".

[Pull Request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request), in very simple terms, is how “open source model” works these days. A contributor asks maintainers whether they would like a patch. If yes, they "pull" the patch into original repository.

Don't let the word "challenge" confuse you, you are not competing with others. You will be getting monthly assignments, and that is the challenge.


# How it works

First, you email neil at bowers dot com. You should tell Neil your GitHub username, and your PAUSE ID if you have one. Tell him you want to join the challenge, and you are in!

You can also join PRC as a team: It could be your company, you and a few friends, or your mongers group. A delegate of group should do exactly the same. Email Neil with GitHub username of the organization, and that's it! 

Each month, you will receive an email from Neil noting your assignment module. You can fix a failing test, add a new test, correct a typo, anything. If it's a team assignment, you should set up a meeting for "assignment hack night", and work on the module with your group.

When done, you should reply to Neil saying "It's done!".

Although it's better to do your assignments every month, you may not be willing to commit to it, and that is fine! If something came up, you can skip a month. If you need more time for a module, you can stick to your assignment for longer. There's a solution as long as you want to submit some PRs.


# Why join

Let me give an interesting reason first. [2018 may be the last year of CPAN-PRC](http://neilb.org/2018/01/01/cpan-prc-2018.html). [It may evolve into issue-based assignments](http://neilb.org/2018/01/06/what-after-prc.html) too. But this will most likely be the **last year** you can get a CPAN module assignment.

I joined this challenge [in 2015](https://kyzn.org/2015-01-17-cpan-pr-challenge-012015.html), when I was still at college. It was a great motivation for me to go read other people's code, even though  I had hard time understanding it. It was also a great chance to get used to open source ecosystem. I did 4 assignments in 2015, another 4 in 2016, and doubled to 8 in 2017. I am also part of [Team-ZipRecruiter](https://github.com/ziprecruiter), which is getting group assignments since April 2017. It really is fun!

If you are looking for more reasons, here's a few.

- If you are a student, and want to learn more about "production-ready" code, this is the perfect opportunity! Remember, you also get to meet people who wrote that code. 
- Or you are a senior programmer, but you haven't contributed to open-source much. This is a great way to begin!
- You do like contributing, but you don't want to spend too much time. This also makes sense! PRC doesn't take too much time, and you can always skip (like I did).
- You spend a lot of time polishing your own modules, but you want to explore other modules: What else is out there? 
- You used to write Perl, but that was years ago. You are looking for a reason to come back.
- You are looking for a programming-related team-building event!
- You are looking for event ideas for some other language community. How awesome is that!

Sounds interesting? Then send an email to neil at bowers dot com with your GitHub username!
