Highlights from TPC 2017

### Disclaimer

This list contains just a small number of talks that I personally thought are important/enjoyable for the most readers. This is by no means an official list curated by an organization. See the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFxdSVDA4v9Af3iutQxLI14m) for all awesome talks. I also encourage you to write your own blog about TPC. And yes, it's officially called "Tipsy" now!



### Where did my test fail?

Although I tried to select talks with videos, I had to make an exception for this one. I wasn't able to locate neither videos mentioned in this section.

On Tuesday night, Damian Conway talked about his new modules: [`Dios`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dios) lets you declare classes with Perl 6 syntax, which uses [`Keyword::Declare`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Keyword::Declare) to declare a couple new keywords it needs. [`Data::Dx`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dx) and [`Test::Expr`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Expr) also utilize "adding new keywords". First one is a wrapper around `Data::Dumper`, and second one is a Test module that prints out source code when an error happens, which apparently was not a thing yet. Pretty awesome, right?

Luckily, Chad Granum (who is working on Test2) was in audience, and the very next day, he announced [`Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag) on Lightning Talks, so this is a thing now! Thanks Damian & Chad!




### Polyglots!

Between the advertisements ("Start a Perl Mongers!", "No no, start a Polyglot Group!", "No, start both!") we did have a couple talks on several languages. Here's a bunch of them, but there are more at YouTube.


"If you think your one programming language is the best thing ever, you are doing life wrong."

### Applications

Hear the story of *BumpySkies*, an application which tells you when to expect turbulance on your flight. It works by looking at flight path *and* weather conditions.

Building a garage-door-controller running on Mojolicious, with Raspberry Pi. There's live demo too!

## Lightning Talks

This year's lightning talk submission form had an extra item: You had to pick whether your LT is serious or fun. I'm going to show one on each end.

## Fun Stuff

David Farrell talks about his *awesome* module [`Cache::Reddit`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Cache::Reddit).

## Serious Business

One thing that most attendees must have noticed is the gender ratio in the conference. If you look at [last year's post-conference survey results](http://yapc-surveys.org/html/yn2016-survey.html), this is the gender ratio you will see:

It doesn't look good at all, and we have to do something about it. Let's hear it from Deidre Foster.

We **have to** do something about it. We should encourage female coworkers/friends to attend and submit talks. We should [update our job ads to be gender-neutral](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/where-does-gender-bias-start-in-the-job-ads/). We should [hire more woman in tech](https://www.hiremorewomenintech.com/). We should [have more policies](http://fogknife.com/2017-05-18-i-want-the-perl-conference-to-steal-cons-policies.html) to make TPC better.



## Speaking of surveys..

If you have attended the conference, survey submissions are due July 7th. Make sure to tell organizers/speakers what you think, make your voice heard. Help people improve what they love to do.



## You **should** submit a talk too!

There's a whole year until the next TPC::NA, but don't be afraid to submit a talk - or multiple talks. Start thinking now. From now on, when you do something interesting, ask yourself if people would like to hear about that. (Spoiler alert: Yes they do!) Take notes, create a very brief outline of your ideas. Keep shaping it, then just submit it. Look for other conferences too!



Thanks for reading!
