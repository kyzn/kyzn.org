Yahoo, the number one web-site in Japan, had a nice campaign on fourth anniversary of Eastern Japan Earthquake that happened on 3/11. For each "3.11" search, they made 10Â¥ donation to relief efforts. Around 3M people participated in "[Search for 3.11](http://search.yahoo.co.jp/searchfor311/2015/)" campaign, and Yahoo is going to donate around $240k. That's pretty nice, not only because they're helping out, but also it's a great way to raise awareness.

They also shared this beautiful visual on mostly searched terms about the sad event. A dramatic increase in earthquake related words can be seen on 3/11 each year. To give an example, "What is meltdown?" was one sad query. You can also play with [this interactive slide](http://search.yahoo.co.jp/searchfor311_2015_flash.html).
