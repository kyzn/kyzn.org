Kosutakvimi Going Down
2015-07-21T21:51:37Z

This is to note that simple calendar I created to list all running events in and around Turkey is no more being maintained. kosutakvimi.org was one of the first neat lists to do its task. It was [introduced](https://kosturmaca.wordpress.com/2014/09/26/bolum-47-spartatlon-ve-yakin-tarihli-kosu-yarislari/) in the only Turkish running podcast. Here are several good alternatives if you want to give it a try:
